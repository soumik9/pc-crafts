                "comment": "The build quality is excellent, and the camera captures decent footage. However, I found the controls a bit challenging to master, especially for beginners. The battery life is also relatively short, limiting flying time. It's a decent option for drone enthusiasts with some experience but may not be the best choice for novices."
